# Why primes?
The study of the primes is as old as the natural numbers themselves. The primes revealed themselves as a direct consequence of the formalism of multiplication (or factorization).
It was observed that the natural numbers exhibit an unusual property - they cannot be factored into anything other than themselves and unity ("1").

Key concepts and formulas:
- Prime counting function: p(n) = number of primes less than or equal to n
- Prime number theorem: p(n) ~ n / log(n) (asymptotic law, error approaches 0 as n approaches inf?)
